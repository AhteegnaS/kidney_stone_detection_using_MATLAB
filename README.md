 kidney_stone_detection_using_MATLAB
 Kidney-stones can be a life-threatening situation. Therefore, timely diagnosis is very
essential. To ensure the efficacy of surgical operations, it is necessary to precisely diagnose
kidney stones. Speckle noise and poor contrast in ultrasound pictures of the kidney make it
difficult to detect stones. As a result, doctors may find it tough and confusing to recognize tiny
kidney stones and their nature. To solve this problem, an image processing-based detection
technique is proposed to determine the exact location of the stones.

 This study presents an ultrasound speckle suppression method to detect the stones in the
human kidney. An initial image is first improved using image enhancement techniques, which
are used to change the imageâ€™s intensities. Next, median filters smooth the picture and eliminate
noise. Preprocessed images are segmented using a thresholding technique. The median filter
extracts impulsive noise from salt-and-pepper noise. The suggested approach locates stones
using location coordinates. Hospital and clinical ultrasound images were used to evaluate the proposed scheme and algorithm. 

The suggested scheme has been assessed by different performance measuringparameters. Physicians are likely to benefit from the research in terms of clinical diagnosis and educational training. Based on 50 test cases, the proposed plan was correct 96.82% of the time and sensitive 92.16% of the time. Furthermore, the peak signal to noise ratio is 1.82, and the average signal to noise ratio is 1.58, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.
